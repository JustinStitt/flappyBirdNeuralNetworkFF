# flappyBirdNeuralNetworkFF
A Feed-Forward Neural Network which enables genetic progression of agents (birds) to beat Flappy Bird.
This is implemented without TensorFlow or any other machine learning library.
Moreover, since my neural network is implemented entirely from scratch using the basic principles and matrix operations. The agents are not given the best possible learning algoirthm or basis on which to succeed. However, I am, nonetheless, proud of my birdies!
